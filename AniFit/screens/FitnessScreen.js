            <Text style = {styles.head}> HIIT</Text>
<Text style={styles.body}>While “hard work, short rests” is the essence of HIIT, there are five main variables that can change the nature of your HIIT workout massively. The first two are your work and rest durations. Working for 40 seconds and resting for 20 is significantly different to resting for 40 and working for 20, with longer work periods generally being better for improving endurance and shorter ones better for power.

Then there’s the intensity of the work periods. With HIIT you need to be pushing hard to get the most benefit from it, and it’s also important to try and maintain a consistent level of effort across the work periods. That means it’s not just about going all-out, because you won’t be able to sustain it across the workout. </Text>

<Text style={styles.header}>1.Walking</Text>
<Text style={styles.body}>It should come as no surprise that walking is one of the best exercises to focus on if you're looking to improve your fitness and lose weight. While the benefits of walking vary depending on sex and weight, walking 1 mile can burn approximately 100 calories.</Text>

<Text style={styles.header}>3.Side Leg Lifts</Text>
<Text style={styles.body}>Leg lifts are a great exercise for working out your lower body, and there are several types of leg lifts you can try. Side leg lifts, or side-lying hip abduction exercises, are one of the best types you may want to give a shot.

Side leg lifts can be extremely beneficial for your lower body and will be helpful for having a well-rounded exercise session. They have been shown to reduce pain and increase muscle performance. One 2011 study, for example, showed that a hip abductor strengthening program significantly reduced pain and increased strength in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS).

To do these leg lifts you'll need to lay on your side, placing the hand from your elevated side onto the floor and your other behind your head. Lift your top leg up as high as it will go and then gently bring it back down. Then repeat the exercise for the opposite side of the body.</Text>
<Text style={styles.header}>4.Modified Squats</Text>
<Text style={styles.body}>Performing squats is one of the best ways to improve personal fitness. Squats are especially beneficial for your leg muscles, but really improve every part of your body if done right. They're also functional, meaning they'll help you get better with everyday movements as well.

Squats are also one of the best exercises for burning calories. According to this formula, a person who weighs 160 pounds and performs squats for 15 minutes will burn around 230 calories.

When performing a basic squat, you'll start standing up. Then, you'll lower your body to the ground. Then you'll slowly rise back up. Some people perform squats while holding a weight in their hands, and there are plenty of variations you can try.

If it's difficult for you to perform a full squat, you can modify it to make it easier for you. To perform a modified squat, do a squat normally. However, instead of lowering your body all the way to the ground, lower it into a chair instead, before rising back up.</Text>
<Text styles={styles.header}>5.Stationary Bike(15-20minutes)</Text>
<Text styles={styles.body}>In addition to walking, riding a stationary bike is a great exercise you can use to improve your body and get your heart rate up. Stationary bikes can come with backrests, providing additional support and a more comfortable experience.

Riding a stationary bike helps strengthening your heart and lungs while also improving your body's ability to use oxygen. It's also a great way to give your lower body a workout and to burn some calories. One study found that a person weighing 185 pounds will burn 311 calories during 30 minutes of moderate riding, and will burn 466 calories during vigorous riding.

While you'll want to do some of the other exercises listed here as well, this is one effective cardio exercise you should consider adding into your routine. </Text>
